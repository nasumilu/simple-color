# simple-color

This is a simple javascript project using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) 
& [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/). The only thing really missing 
is to update the colors from input[type="text"]. 

# Usage

1. Download or clone the repository
2. Run
```sh
yarn install
```
3. Bundle using Parcel
```sh
yarn build
```
Then open (`Ctl+O`) your browser to the build/index.html

or to watch for changes use (development)
```sh
yarn start
```
Then open the browser to `http://localhost:1234` or which ever port
is showing in the terminal

# simple-color

This is a simple javascript project using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) 
& [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/). The only thing really missing 
is to update the colors from input[type="text"]. 

# Usage

1. Download or clone the repository
2. Run
```sh
yarn install
```
or with npm
```sh
npm install
```
3. Bundle using Parcel
```sh
yarn build
```
or with npm

```sh
npm run build
```

or to watch for changes use (development)
```sh
yarn start
```
or with npm
```sh
npm run start
```

Then open the browser to `http://localhost:1234` or which ever port
is showing in the terminal
